# Welcome to the Epitome project

You have our deep gratitude for deciding to contribute to the development of Epitome. You can help the project by contirbuting new features, patches, bug reports, tutorials, documentation, and artwork. We welcome all contributors regardless of skill or experience level. We want to make participation as easy as possible, by providing support to contributors, especially those who are new. This can include providing feedback on your patches among other things.  However by following the guidelines below contributors can decrease the amount of support required, which makes the process easier and better for everyone.

We expect all contributors uphold a positive and respectful behaviour as explained in the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting bugs and issues

* **Please first make sure that your issue is not already reported, by using the GitHub issue search** as it would greatly help to gather information about different instances of a single bug.
* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. **Don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. 
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.

## Contributing code

* [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it in your local machine and make your changes.

* We encourage testing before merging a pull-request. **Pull Requests should usually be made for the `development` branch** as this contains the most recent version of the code.

* Push the changes to your fork and [submit a new pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) with a clear list of what you've done and a descriptive title.
