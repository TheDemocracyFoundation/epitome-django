# Epitome documentation

### Installation

<p align="justify">In order to install Epitome, python 3 must be installed in order to create a virtual environment. After that, django must be installed via pip. Create a new project using django’s “startproject” command, and in that new project, import the Epitome files. Epitome will be finally set up using the settings.py script and will run using the embedded server.</p>

In an Ubuntu based operating system:

1) It is recommended that you first update your operating system by typing:

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt full-upgrade`

2) [Download the repository from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) somewhere in your desktop (so it won't interfere with the folder we will create in your home directory).

3) Install required dependencies:

`sudo apt install python3`

and

`sudo apt install python3-venv`

4) Install pip by typing:

`sudo apt install python3-pip`

5) The version already installed may be outdated. Update by typing:

`sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools`

6) Go to the home directory and create a new directory for the virtual environment:

`cd ~`

and

`mkdir venvs`

7) Specify the system python3 installation:

`python3 -m venv venvs/Epitome`

8) Activate the virtual environment:

`source ~/venvs/Epitome/bin/activate`

upgrade pip3 again in case it requires it

`pip3 install --upgrade pip`

Install django

`pip3 install django`

9) Create a new project by typing:

`django-admin startproject Epitome`

**Important: This will create a new folder named "Epitome" in your current directory, go into the newly created folder, find the folder "Epitome" and the file "settings.py" and save it somewhere seperately**

10) Move all the contents of Epitome (the folder which you downloaded from our repository) to the newly created folder replacing all the existing files

11) Open the settings.py that you saved seperately and add the secret key field to the settings.py file in the Epitome folder that was generated in your local machine (and which should now have the settings.py file that you downloaded), it should look somewhat like this:

`SECRET_KEY = 'ibk%9)u6z0c3b$#rm^y1j@nk4@x6es$+dn%f2yx^c87pcf-1)o'
`

12) From the terminal, change the directory into the newly created folder and make the database migrations by typing:

`cd ~/Epitome`

and

`python3 manage.py makemigrations Eisegesis`

and

`python3 manage.py makemigrations Agora`

and

`python3 manage.py makemigrations Propylaea`

and

`python3 manage.py migrate`

13) To start django server move to the folder Epitome and start the server by typing:

`python3 manage.py runserver`

14) To create an admin account, open a new terminal, re-activate the virtual environment and type and follow the instructions:

`source ~/venvs/Epitome/bin/activate`

and

`cd ~/Epitome`

and

`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

15) Open your web browser to access the admin panel in this address:

<http://localhost:8000/admin/>

16) To access Epitome enter the following address:

<http://localhost:8000/user/login>

*Usernames are case-sensitive.okkkkkk

You should now have a working instance of Epitome.

### Troubleshooting

* Issue: django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: Error loading MySQLdb module: No module named MySQLdb

Solution: install python-mysqldb by writing

 `sudo apt install python-mysqldb`

* Issue: django.db.utils.OperationalError: (2003, "Can't connect to MySQL server on '127.0.0.1' (111)")

Solution: Check if you have correctly configured the fields under the "DATABASES = {" section of the settings.py file.
located inside the "Epitome" folder
 
* Issue: when typing "sudo python manage.py migrate" you get the following
 `'NAME': 'os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3')',
                                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax`

Solution: make sure you remove the 'apostrophes' from the "NAME:" field under the "DATABASES = {" section of the settings.py file.

* Issue: You try to run the server again after you closed it and you get the message "Error: That port is already in use."

Solution: kill all the processes associated with port 8000 by typing 

`sudo fuser -k 8000/tcp`

* Issue: Import error, No module named urls

Solution: Change line in file Eisegesis/views.py

`from django.url import reverse`

to

`from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse`
